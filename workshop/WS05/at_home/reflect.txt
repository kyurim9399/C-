The type of id and age of employee is int and the type of salary is double. 
If we tried to use array instead of structure,
it would have been difficult to collect these different types of variables. 
The good thing about tying it is that when you sand data to a function,
we just cross over the structure. 
This has the advantage of being able to change the data that we want to deliver
without changing the declaration of the function,
even if we add parameters to the function later.
This is because only one field needs to be added or deleted in the structure declaration. 
It is also readable because we only need to put name of structures
in the a parentheses-enclosed list of parameters of function.


In addition to the method of declaring a structure declaration to a c file,
there is a method of storing it in a separate file called a header file.
The good thing about this is that the structure
we declared can be applied to more than one source code, not just one source file.
Also, when we need to modify it, we only need to modify it in the header file. 

It was a little hard to use the things I learned earlier in this assignment.
But it was good to have a chance to review once more.
When I removed employee information in case 4, I only initialized employee information.
However, that way, they were not able to enter information from new employees.
I thought I'd have to be more specific when I wrote the code.
