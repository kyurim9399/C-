I coded without using pseudo-coding.
I first wrote a statement in Visual Studio that I thought could do this.
Then, I used Debug to check the results and made minor modifications continuously.
So I spent a lot of time coding.
Perhaps I didn't understand the iteration exactly, so I didn't know which command to put in it to get the result I wanted.
If I am more faithful to the basics and grasp the itemization properly, I will be able to code it faster by thinking about the whole.


I used while construct in my at home assignment.
Of the three iterations, the one that I'm still familiar with is While construct.
Especially, it was easier to use because it was similar to if construct when condition is one.
For c0nstruct needs to write initializaion, condition, and change at once, which is not yet familiar to me.


I liked the fact that I didn't have to keep writing things over and over again.
And the process of thinking about writing it in simpler coding was interesting.
It was like solving a math problem.
The hard part was thinking like a computer.
It is very easy for me to find the average, or find the maximum and minimum temperatures.
But computers had to compare numbers one by one to find the maximum temperature, which was a little hard to think about.
