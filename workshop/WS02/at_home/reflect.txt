I learned how I can do casting through this workshop.
Also I learned how to set a variable set to a double to an int.
It was difficult to convert floating-point values to integers.
In particular, the part that I had to add 0.005 was that I never thought of.
Rather than just seeing a variety of expressions in books, it was easier to understand.

Because computers use binary, they have limitations in expressing decimal parts.
Therefore, numbers cannot be represented exactly like integers.
It's a good idea to convert floatin-point values to integers for more accurate calculations.

I think the expression is simpler.
In fact, to get the remainder, we need to subtract the divisor times the quotient from the dividend.
remainder = dividend - (divisor * quotient)
This complex expression can be obtained with a single symbol like %.
