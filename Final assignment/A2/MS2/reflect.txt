In this assignment I learned how to implement a function and how it is used in other code.
I think we were able to use the function to make the code more detailed.
In addition, it is easier to read the code that was used repeatedly by using a function.

A function is a part of a code that performs a specific function in the C program.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that are called a standard function.
A function that the user creates and uses is called a user-defined function.
The reason for using functions is to make it easy to manage repeated codes.
If we only use it once, it would be easier and faster to enter the variable in the main.
However, if we use the code a lot like 100 or 200 times, we can create code easier and shorter without long code by declaring a function.
Also, once we create a function, we can reuse it later when we make other programs.

The functions defined in the "helper" are required to briefly represent the codes of the "contact".
However, the "helper" functions are stored separately because I think they are less relevant to the code flow of "contacts".
It is difficult to write down the code at once if the program we have to create is large or complex.
To implement a program, analyze the functions required for the implementation and design various modules based on the analysis results.
And we have to build a program using a well-diviede module.
A well-designed program requires that each module consists only of code that is related to each other,
and that it is less relevant to other modules.
By dividing the program into smaller-sized module,
the scope of the change can be reduced and smaller when the source code needs to be changed due to a problem.
