Doing this assignment was a good opportunity to create a function of various uses.
Trying to create various functions was a very valuable exercise.

Using the findContactIndex and getTemDigitPhone functions has been very helpful in the source code.
First, use functions to avoid duplication of code.
For example, there is a 50-line function. If I want to use the function again in another section, it becomes 100 lines.
If I use it again, there are 150 lines.
However, using functions only requires one line, which makes the code simpler.
This simplified code is readable for other developers.

Second, a function written once can be reused multiple times.
Functions used when using some program development may be needed when doing other development.
In this case, I can save time because I can import the function I used previously or use a little modification.

Finally, maintenance becomes easier.
The function allows the entire program to be divided into modules, making the development process easier and more systematic.
If an update is required or an error occurs, the function requires only one modification.
It is easier to manage as a whole source code.

If fewer of the contact information to manage this task, it is unlikely to be required.
But I think If necessary, to this assignment in a lot of contact information.
Sometimes we enter the data incorrectly by mistakes.
If I use this assignment, when I input the character in cellphone number,
the error message pops up telling me to write down the number.
Terefore, we can fill out the appropriate informaion in the data file.
Also, when I enter a phone number, I can see all the infromation of the person who dorresponds to that phone number.
