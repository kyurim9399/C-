It was a good assignment to have time to practice structure once again.
Using scanf, it was possible to compare the use of & for array input and & when variable is int.
The most difficult thing was to use [^\n] when including space.
When I first got a clear keyboard, I was embarrassed because I didn't know why it was like this.


Maybe I don't know much, so I don't know if there's a better way to ask 
to add information to the data field without using structure.
I think it's good to use structure because I can combine various information.
There are many variables of different types,
but since it is one person's information,
storing it in one place is more efficient in managing the information.


A string is a sequence of characters treated as a single entity and is terminated by a null character (‘\0’).
For example, string[3]= “hi”;
Character (char) is a primitive data type in C that is used to store a character value. 
An array is defined as a finite collection of homogeneous data, stored in contiguous memory locations.
C language however doesn’t support string as a data type. We can implement strings as array of characters.
For example, array[2]={'h','i'};
When I attempt to display the contents of a primitive character array (not a C string) using the printf specifier “%s”,
the unknown characters are also printed along with 'hi'.
