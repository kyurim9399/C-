The structure and function were used this assignment to produce the same result as the previous assignment.
When I did my last assignment, I never thought I could use a function to make the same result.
It was harder than I thought to write down the code because I was not used to using functions and pointers.
On the one hand, it was amazing that I could create different ways of code to produce the same result.

In this assignment, another structure called contact was added.
I think when we call the function from a1ms4.c, we added a structure called contact to write down the parameters more simply.
Thus, it was possible to express 'structure something' simply as a 'contact'.
Because code should be easy to understand by anyone.

The reasons why this is a bad design are as follows.
First, if the structure is large and I am passing structure variables frequently
then it can take quite a bit of time which make the program inefficient.
Second, Additional memory is required to save every copy of the structure.
